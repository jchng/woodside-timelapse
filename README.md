# Woodside Timelapse (WIP)
A simple python script that pulls an image off [Monash University's Woodside](https://www.monash.edu/it/woodside-building) construction site every 10 minutes.

Motivations: 
* Being able to generate a time-lapse video of the construction.
* Was unable to find a repository of all of the images taken by the time-lapse camera.
* My lonely Rapsberry Pi 2 can finally work on something.

Requires: 
* `pip3 install wget`
* `sudo apt install ffmpeg`
