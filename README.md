# Woodside Timelapse
A simple python script that pulls an image off [Monash's woodside construction site](https://www.monash.edu/it/woodside-building) every 10 minutes.

Motivations: 
* Being able to generate a time-lapse video of the building.
* Was unable to find a repository of all of the images taken by the time-lapse camera.

Requires: 
* `pip3 install wget`
* `pip3 install ffmpeg`
